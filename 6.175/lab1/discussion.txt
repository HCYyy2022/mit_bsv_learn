Write your answers to these questions in the text file discussion.txt provided with the initial lab code.
1. How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use? The 5-bit multiplexer? Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)

(1) one-bit multiplexer : 4 (one OR,one NOT, two AND )
(2) 5-bit multiplexer   : 20
(3) formula  : 4*N


2. Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require? How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)

(1) rca : 5*8 = 40  
(2) csa : 
    adder             : 5*8 = (5*8)*3/2 = 60 
    5-bit multiplexer : 5*4 = 20
    all               : 60 + 20 = 80


3. Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. In terms of A and M,
 how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take? How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
 
(1)8-bit ripple-carry adder: 8*A
(1)8-bit carry-select adder: 4*A + M


4. Optional: How long did you take to work on this lab?
4 hours
